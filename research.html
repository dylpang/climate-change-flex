      <p class="caption">Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
        Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.</p>

        <h1 class="label">CAUSES</h1>
        <p class="label">Human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earthâ€™s atmosphere, warming the planet. Natural drivers, without human intervention, would push our planet toward a cooling period.</p>
        <h2 class="label">EFFECTS</h2>
        <p class="label">The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible on the timescale of people alive today, and will worsen in the decades to come.</p>
